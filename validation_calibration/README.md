These folders are used to validate and calibrate the LISFLOOD-FP flood model. Download all these three folders into your local computer and start to run the script from the script folder. The scripts were written in jupyter notebook, so we suggest to use jupyter notebook with the kernel of the environment installed earlier. Please change the path in ```basepath```, ```os.chir```, and ```main_dir``` to the ```data``` folder path as it stores all the data sources. After that, please run the script as the order below. **_Notice_**: Land (51559) and bathymetry (50554) files were downloaded on 15/04/2024. The OpenStreetMap data was downloaded into cache folder on 25/01/2023. Hence, the reproducible work could be different because the versions of these data could be changed.
