Title: Quantifying uncertainty in flood predictions caused by transforming square grid orientation in LiDAR-derived DEM process

Authors: Martin Nguyen, Matthew D. Wilson, Emily M. Lane, James Brasington, and Rose A. Pearson

## Introduction

Digital elevation models (DEM), typically generated by sampling and interpolation LiDAR data onto a North-South square grid, are crucial for reliable flood predictions. However, the orientation of this grid, which can introduce variability in elevation data and impact flood predictions, is often overlooked. The below figure illustrates the difference in sampling and interpolating artificial LiDAR data (ground elevation: 1 m, river elevation: 0.5 m) onto a North-South square grid versus a 45-degree rotated grid at 10-meter resolution. This significantly affects river representation as seen in river profiles, potentially creating varying waterways. Hence, this project aims to quantify the uncertainty in flood model outputs caused by transforming this grid orientation.

## Workflow

We used a traditional Monte Carlo framework to generate multiple DEMs by rotating and/or translating a square grid. These DEMs were created using GeoFabrics package [(version 0.9.4)](https://github.com/rosepearson/GeoFabrics/commit/7a4ebca4e3f2e0c3f9218f7b1ef07ee470d51cb7) provided by [Dr. Rose A. Pearson](https://github.com/rosepearson/GeoFabrics/wiki) and published [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815223002281). Using the LISFLOOD-FP flood model, we produced multiple flood predictions for analysis from these DEMs. This approach was applied to various transformations (East, North, North-East translation, rotation, and combined rotation and North-East translation), resolutions (2, 5, 10, and 20 meters), and flood return periods (5, 10, 20, 50, 80 (or January-2005), and 1000 years).

## Site study

The Waikanae river, situated on the West Coast of the Wellington Region in New Zealand, was selected for this project. In tha figure below, images A and B depict the area of interest in this paper, selected from the vicinity of the Waikanae Water Treatment Plant gauge and extending approximately 5 km toward the Waikanae coastal region. In the image B, the bright blue line represents the Waikanae river. Image C presents a DEM with a hillshade effect, representing Waikanae topographic features.

## Representative result

The figure below demonstrates the effect of transforming the square grid orientation on the flood predictions. It shows the proportion of times a location/each pixel was predicted to be flooded across all simulations. The results suggest that in some simulations, topographic effects due to the changes in the grid orientation prevented water from reaching specific locations. This is evident in the upper part of the blue zoomed-in image or at the flood extent boundaries in the figure.
