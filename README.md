Title: Quantifying uncertainty in flood predictions caused by transforming square grid orientation in LiDAR-derived DEM process

Authors: Martin Nguyen, Matthew D. Wilson, Emily M. Lane, James Brasington, and Rose A. Pearson

## Introduction

Digital elevation models (DEM), typically generated by sampling and interpolation LiDAR data onto a North-South square grid, are crucial for reliable flood predictions. However, the orientation of this grid, which can introduce variability in elevation data and impact flood predictions, is often overlooked. The below figure illustrates the difference in sampling and interpolating artificial LiDAR data (ground elevation: 1 m, river elevation: 0.5 m) onto a North-South square grid versus a 45-degree rotated grid at 10-meter resolution. This significantly affects river representation as seen in river profiles, potentially creating varying waterways. Hence, this project aims to quantify the uncertainty in flood model outputs caused by transforming this grid orientation.

## Workflow

We used the traditional Monte Carlo framework to generate multiple DEMs by rotating and/or translating a square grid. Using the LISFLOOD-FP flood model, we produced multiple flood predictions for analysis. This approach was applied to various transformations (East, North, North-East translation, rotation, and combined rotation and North-East translation), resolutions (2, 5, 10, and 20 meters), and flood return periods (5, 10, 20, 50, 80 (or January-2005), and 1000 years).

## Representative result

The figure below demonstrates the effect of transforming the square grid orientation on the flood predictions. It shows the proportion of times a location/each pixel was predicted to be flooded across all simulations. The results suggest that in some simulations, topographic effects due to the changes in the grid orientation prevented water from reaching specific locations. This is evident in the upper part of the blue zoomed-in image or at the flood extent boundaries in the figure.

## Reproducible work

The instruction below is for reproducing this project. It will take 1-2 days to generate a version but some might take more than a week (e.g: 2-meter resolution). Please contact with the Github author if further information is needed.

### Environment installation

Download file ```gri_orientaion_packages.yaml``` and use the following command (reference from the answer of [@merv](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76800978/conda-invalidversionspec-invalid-version-error-when-tryin-to-install-from-requi)) to recreate the anaconda environment (only support Windows at the moment).

```
conda env create -n gridorientation -f gridorientation.yaml
```

### Data

The DEMs in this work are created thanks to the GeoFabrics package (version 0.9.4) provided by Dr. [R. A. Pearson](https://github.com/rosepearson/GeoFabrics/wiki) her work can be read [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815223002281). This project includes 3 main folders as described below.

#### 1. File validation_calibration

This file includes three other files - data, results, and scripts. These files were used to validate and calibrate the LISFLOOD-FP flood model.
- Data file includes all data that are necessary for validating and calibrating the flood model. Notice here the land (51559) and bathymetry (50554) were downloaded on 15/04/2024. The OpenStreetMap data was downloaded into cache file on 25/01/2023. Hence, the reproducible work could be different because the versions of these data could be changed.
- Scripts file includes all scripts to validate and calibrate the LISFLOOD-FP flood model.
- Results file includes the results from our work after running the scripts file.

#### 2. File simulation

This file includes two files - data and script.
- Data file includes initial data which cannot be generated automatically from the script file.
- Scripts file includes three other files - Modelling, Analysing, and Executing. The Modelling file includes all the modules used to create multiple DEMs and flood predictions by transforming the grid orientation. The Analysing file includes all the modules used to extract all uncertainties and analyse them. The Executing file includes all the scripts to run the Modelling and Analysing file.
- The results for these scripts are very large (4TB). Please contact with the author if you would like to know more details.

#### 3. File other_files

This file includes two big files - script and data.
- Data file includes all the files used for figures in the journal.
- Scripts file includes all the script used to create data file.
